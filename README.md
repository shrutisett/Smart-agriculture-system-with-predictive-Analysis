# Smart-agriculture-system-with-predictive-Analysis

This project focuses on smart agriculture using IoT and machine learning to predict suitable crops.
It collects real-time temperature and soil moisture data through Tinkercad simulation.
A Random Forest Classifier is used for accurate crop prediction based on environmental conditions.
An IR sensor and buzzer system are added for basic field security and intrusion alerts.
